Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

 **Project Description**
This project is focused on building a machine learning-based solution to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The system processes email text, extracts meaningful features, and applies machine learning algorithms to predict whether a given email is spam.

**Features**
- Preprocessing of email text, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Classification using **Naive Bayes** and other machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Future support for real-time email spam detection.

 **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `sklearn` - Machine learning and feature extraction
  - `nltk` - Natural language processing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Data visualization

## **Dataset**
The project uses a publicly available dataset for spam email classification, such as the [Spam Email]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email/data)) or a similar dataset. The dataset contains labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails.

 **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavi-M-1909/Spam-mail
   ```
2. Go to Google colab and upload the notebook
3. Upload dataset in the notebook
  

 **Usage**
1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Place your dataset file (`spam.csv`)
2. **Output:**
   - The system will preprocess the dataset, train the model, and display evaluation metrics.



 **Project Workflow**
 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converting text to lowercase.
   - Removing punctuation, special characters, and stop words.
   - Tokenizing and lemmatizing text.

 2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Text converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.

 3. **Model Training**
   - Models like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** are trained and evaluated.

 4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics used: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.
   - Confusion matrix visualized for better insights.

 5. **Fine-tuning**
   - Experimentation with hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

 **Future Work**
- Integrate a real-time email spam detection system.
- Experiment with advanced models like **BERT** or **Transformer-based NLP models**.
- Implement a user-friendly interface (e.g., web app or desktop app).
